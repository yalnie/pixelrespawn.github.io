## Information We Collect

The App itself does not collect or store any personal information on our servers. However, certain features involve third-party services:

### 1. RetroAchievements
- If you choose to log in to your RetroAchievements account, your username and password are transmitted **securely** to RetroAchievements’ servers for authentication, and Linkboy stores your RetroAchievements username and a secure login token on your device to maintain your session until you sign out in Linkboy settings. **Your password is never stored on your device.**
- Any data transmitted to RetroAchievements is sent to their servers, which are located in Nuremberg, Germany.
- Gameplay information, such as game identification, achievement progress, and leaderboard scores, may be sent to RetroAchievements so these features work.
- Linkboy does not transmit personal data to its own servers. Any data sent to RetroAchievements is managed by RetroAchievements, who provide mechanisms for data access, correction, and deletion in accordance with GDPR.

### 2. Google Drive Sync
- If you choose to sync with Google Drive, the App requests access using the `drive.file` permission.
- Only save files and cheats created by Linkboy are uploaded, and the App does not have access to any other files in your Google Drive.
- You can revoke access at any time in your Google Account settings.

---

## Data Sharing
Data is only transmitted to the services you explicitly connect (RetroAchievements and Google Drive) so their features can function.

---

## Your Choices
- You can use the App without signing in to RetroAchievements or enabling Google Drive sync.
- You may revoke Google Drive permissions at any time via your Google Account.
- You may manage or delete your RetroAchievements account directly through the RetroAchievements website.

---

## Children’s Privacy
Linkboy is **not specifically directed to children under 13**.

- The App may be used by people of all ages, but we recommend parental guidance for younger users.
- We do **not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13**.
- Features that involve signing into RetroAchievements or syncing with Google Drive require an account, which should be managed by a parent or guardian if used by a child under 13.
