# Using Linkboy

## Import saves from the My Boy! emulator { #import-saves }

!!! note
    Only **in-game saves** (as opposed to state saves) can be shared between emulators.

1. In Linkboy, tap the **_Settings_** tab on the bottom. Scroll down, find and tap **_Open app folder_**. A file manager will show up.

2. In the file manager, click the 3-bar icon on the top-left, scroll down and tap **My Boy!**.

    !!! note
        If you can't find it, please update My Boy! to the latest version.

3. The file manager should now show the internal file structure of My Boy!. Tap the **_save_** subfolder.

4. Select all the files ending with **_.sav_** that you would like to import by tapping the icons on the left side of the file names.

    !!! tip
        * If the file names are too long and hard to read, it may be helpful to switch to list view and landscape mode.

        * You can select all files regardless of their types, but only .sav files will be recognized by Linkboy.

5. Tap the 3-dot icon on the top-right, choose **_Copy to…_**

6. Once again, click the 3-bar icon on the top-left but choose **Linkboy** this time.

7. The file manager should now show the internal file structure of Linkboy. Tap the **_saves_** subfolder.

    !!! note
        The saves folder may not have been created if you have not yet used Linkboy to play a game. In that case, you can manually create one with the file manager.

8. Tap the **_Copy_** button, which will copy all your selected files to this folder.

    !!! note
        If there are already files with the same names, they will be renamed to _.bak_ before being overwritten.

9. Now switch back to Linkboy and start playing your game. The game should be able to recognize your saves (not the save slots in emulator's menu).

    !!! warning "Important"
        If you previously played the game on Linkboy, an auto save-state would have been created, which includes a stale copy of the in-game save. In that case, you can either:

        - close the game, and turn off **_Auto load last state_** in the settings, and then start the game again. You can turn it back on afterwards.

        - or simply delete the corresponding _.slot(auto).sst_ file from the saves folder in the file manager.
